Hi y'all, I'm a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Rice University, advised by Prof. Tirthak Patel. My research interest includes Quantum Computing and Security.

Before joining Rice, I had my Master's Degree in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis in Dec 2021. I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ning Zhang at CSPL working on Control-Flow Integrity in Cyber-Physical Systems.
